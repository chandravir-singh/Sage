## About

I have created a project where I am aiming to create a mental health care application the name of the application is Sage. The application uses firebase authentication and the application is a native android application built on android studio with the help of kotlin and jetpack compose. It deals with the diagnosis and treatment of mental health problems such as anxiety, depression, ADHD, etc.

I have proposed a solution in which my Generative AI(Google Gemini 1.5pro) which I have finetuned from google cloud vertex AI platform this model acts as a mental health therapist which is the persona I have given to it. It will ask questions to suggest whether the user is suffering from any mental disorder it uses nlp for text to speech and speech to text. Additionally, my application is having AR/VR spaces to create a feel-good environment for the user, along with a talk-back AR AI therapist.

## Points to remember while testing the app

1. Allow *permission* for Internet.
2. Allow *permission* for Microphone.
